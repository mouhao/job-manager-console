TODO:
MP 12/11/2003 -- create/update/sync jobDefinition interface
        and
	bugfix.   Test debug cituations where unschedule is not working.

Misc stuff todo:

We need a bunch of built in jobs that are use full.  These will be added to the main quartz project.  (I just finished the NativeJob).
Some ideas(An AntJob that will run targets from and ant build file), sql job, some type of data dump job, email, file sends, and a directory scanner that will launch another job whenever a directory changes).


Other ideas that might need to be entertained
-->
security -- perhaps this app should have a logon
log--we need a way for view as history for what has run along with job output


Done: Nov 1, 2003

Perhaps a more wizard like schedule job form.  i.e. hide the raw crontab format.
Tabs could be used to provide a wizard/advanced format.
--fixed ui cron trigger entry method.


Done:

Facility to create jobs based on a JobDefinition.  The create (custom) job will still remain as part of the application. The idea is that people with have JobDefinitions for common jobs that are re-used all the time.
Validation of this type of entry form(based on "required" and mask).

Here is an example definition file.

<definitions>
  <definitionList>
    <definition>
      <name>NativeJob</name>
      <className>org.quartz.jobs.NativeJob</className>
      <description>Job for running Native executables</description>
       <parameters>
        <parameter>
          <description>actual executable name with for path</description>
          <mask></mask>
          <name>command name</name>
          <required>true</required>
        </parameter>
        <parameter>
          <description>Parameter String</description>
          <name>parameters</name>
          <required>false</required>
        </parameter>
      </parameters>
    </definition>
  </definitionList>
</definitions>




If you have any other ideas, let me know.
